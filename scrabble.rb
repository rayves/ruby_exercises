The year is 2021, and theres been a new version of scrabble created. This version is much more simple. The points are scored according to the letters position in the alphabet. a = 1. b = 2, c = 3....etc. With the highest word winning that round.

Create a method that will receive a string of one or many words, separated by a space, and returns the highest scoring word. 

If two words score the same, return the one that appears first.

You will only receive lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z).

E.g. word_ranking('hi there'), should return 'there'

As 'hi' is worth 17, whilst 'there' is worth 56, so 'there' is returned

E.g. word_ranking('reshow the shower') -> 'reshow'
