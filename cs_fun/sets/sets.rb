Implement the common set operations: intersection, union, symmetric difference

The **union** function takes 2 arrays as input, and returns the union of those two arrays.

Example:

union([1,2,3], [3,4,5])   # should return [1,2,3,4,5]

union(["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e", "f"]) # should return ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]

The **intersection** function takes 2 arrays as input and returns the intersection.

Example:

intersection([1,2,3],[3,4,5])  # should return [3]

The **symmetric_difference** function takes 2 arrays as input as returns the symmetric difference (all elements in one or the other set, but not both).

Example:

symmetric_difference([1,2,3],[3,4,5]) # should return [1,2,4,5]

Implement these yourself - not using the Set class.

	# return the union

def symmetric_difference(set1, set2)
