We have done a Fibonacci challenge in the past, time to meet his sister, Tribonacci!

Tribonacci will take the last 3 inputs (as oppose to 2), and add them together to get another value. 

Create a method that will be given an array and an integer as it's argument. The array will hold the first 3 numbers of the tribonacci sequence, whilst the integer will be the nth number of the sequence we want to access.

E.g. tribonacci([1,1,2], 5), should return 7 -> (as the sequence would add 1 + 1 + 2 to get 4, so would be [1,1,2,4], then would add 1 + 2 + 4, and get 7, so would be [1,1,2,4,7], meaning our final result would be 7)

E.g. tribonacci([5,6,11], 9), should return 449


This is a super hard challenge, but use the skills you have, pseudocode and team work, and you'll be fine!
