What is pig latin? Pig latin takes the first letter of every word, moves it to the end of the word and adds an ‘ay’ after it. For example, "the quick brown fox" becomes "hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay".

Write a method that translates a text to Pig Latin.

E.g. pig_latin("Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane are possible destinations") should return "ydneySay roay elbourneMay roay risbaneBay reaay ossiblepay estinationsday"

E.g. pig_latin("A") should return "Aay"

E.g. pig_latin("") should return ""
